Client server UDP communication between two esp01

UDp stands for User Datagram Protocol is one of the core members of internet protocols.
UDP is unreliable but it works for small things as it allows us to send data to multiple 
devices on same network.It also has limitation on its  data sending packet upto several bytes only
and its  neither a two way communication,i.e if the server sends data to client and if client is some how unable
to recieve that data then the server won't be able to know and this could lead to data loss.
